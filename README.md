## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [Horizontal scroller](https://jsfiddle.net/jonigiuno/4jwHF/) - This fiddle and Joni's comment on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/horizontal-scrolling-but-only-a-part-of-a-website/#post-135034) have saved me from a lot of headaches. I didn't want to take the easy road and import a library that would do all the heavy lifting (at least, not for things concerning the frontend). I wanted to make the horizontal scroller from scratch and to really understand what's going on under the hood. Joni's example helped tremendeously with that!
